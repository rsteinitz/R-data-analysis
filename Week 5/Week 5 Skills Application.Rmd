# Skills Application

Try the following short exercises using either your own dataset or the Week 5 example dataset:
in R Course Materials for Students > Sample data

`diabetes.csv` – Pima Indians Diabetes dataset from Kaggle

Use either the Week 5 example dataset or your own dataset from a previous week.
These exercises combine ideas from Week 2 (wrangling), Week 3 (grouping & summarizing), and Week 4 (joining & visualization), while adding this week’s focus on distribution shape and data transformations.

## 1. Spot the skew:  
Create a long-format dataset containing several numeric variables (e.g., Glucose, BMI, Insulin).  
- Use `geom_density()` or `geom_histogram()` to visualize the distribution of each.  
- Which variables look normally distributed, and which are skewed?  
- In one or two sentences, describe how skew might affect summary statistics or interpretation in your dataset.  


## 2. Reveal a hidden relationship:  
- Pick two numeric variables that appear curved or noisy when plotted together.  
- Make one scatterplot using the raw values, and another after transforming one variable with `log10()` or z-score.  
- Compare the two plots — does the relationship become more linear or clearer after transformation?  


## 3. Compare summaries before and after transformation:  
- Choose one skewed variable (e.g., Insulin).  
- Use `summarise()` to calculate `mean()`, `median()`, and `sd()` before and after applying `log10()` or `scale()`.  
- Plot both versions using facet_wrap() or two density plots side by side.  
- How do the mean and median differ? Which transformation better reduces skew?  


## 4. Standardization in practice:  
- Select two variables with different scales (for example, Glucose and BMI).  
- Create new z-score columns using `scale()` and add them to your dataframe.  
- Make a scatterplot comparing the z-scores and discuss how standardizing helps when variables are in different units.  
- What does a value of +1 or -1 standard deviation represent for your variables?  


## 5. Bring it all together:
- Choose any dataset you’ve worked with so far (e.g., from the gapminder or forest_long exercises).  
- Identify one skewed numeric variable and apply an appropriate transformation.  
- Use visualizations (geom_density(), geom_smooth()) and summaries to show how interpretability or linearity improves.  

> Tip: Save your transformed data and plots as new R objects. You’ll reuse them later when we begin exploring correlations and model fitting in the next unit.
